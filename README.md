# Radio List
A list of all radios for our APIs, maintained by us and the community.

## Folder structure
`services/` the radio data, which should contain only .js files

`tags/` contains a file which exports all the tags which may be used by services

## Examples
View the [InsideFM](https://github.com/RoyaliTEA-News/radios/blob/main/services/InsideFM.js) code for an example of a service which uses AzuraCast.
The [UpBeat](https://github.com/RoyaliTEA-News/radios/blob/main/services/UpBeat.js) service shows how to use a custom service by supplying the endpoint and all JSON nodes needed. We currently only support JSON REST APIs.
